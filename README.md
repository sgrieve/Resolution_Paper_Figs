# Code and data to generate figures for Grieve et al. (2016)

This repo contains the python code and associated data files used to generate the figures in Grieve et al. (2016) - How does grid-resolution modulate the topographic expression of geomorphic processes?

Each figure contained in its own subfolder, some paths may need updated depending on the structure of your local machine.

Spatial data is not included here but can be downloaded from [this link](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/Res_Data/Res_Data_Pack.zip). All other data is included within the scripts or in the two folders with the suffix `_data`.
